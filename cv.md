Young, easy trained and curious, I'm ready to learn the new technologies and improve my skills in web development. Now I'm working as a content manager - I build websites and landing pages using CMS, deploy and maintain them. But as I became passionate about programming, I want to know how to create applications and websites from concept through deployment. When I get enough practical experience, I'm hoping to find a company where I would evolve with a team and became a good specialist. I'm interested in engineering, computer science and different development practices. In other words, I'm trying to learn something new every day.

## Skills:
* HTML5
* CSS3 + Responsive Design, Flexbox and Grid Layout
* CSS Preprocessors (Sass)
* CSS and JS Framework Bootstrap 3, 4
* Module bundlers and task runners (Gulp 4, Webpack)
* Version Control (Git)
* JavaScript (ES6)
* JS Libraries (JQuery)
* Still learning React
* Basic knowledge of PHP
* Content Management Systems (WordPress, 1C Bitrix)
* Graphics editors (Figma, Adobe Photoshop)

## Code examples:
```javascript
const partialApply = (fn, arg2) => (arg1) => fn(arg1, arg2);

const pow = (a, b) => a ** b;
const f1 = partialApply(pow, 2);
f1(1); // 1
f1(10); // 100
```

Here are some of my educational projects:
#### [Brain Games](https://github.com/foggylight/frontend-project-lvl1)
Brain Games is the set of five console games.
The biggest part of this project was obtaining a practice in: 
* setting up the development environment, making the right app architecture;
* using npm and Git;
* setting up a linter (Eslint), writing and organizing code by Airbnb Style Guide.

#### [Cognitive Biases]()
This is a simple landing page. In this project I organized the code according to the OOCSS methodology: components are modular and classes can be reused. I practiced my skills in the basics of layout and content positioning, main blocks are built by using flexbox.
